No problem! Here's an updated version of your `README.md` without the `requirements.txt` reference, as you used `ultralytics` directly. I'll include a note for installing it and any other dependencies.

# Football Analysis Model

This repository contains a Python program that performs football player detection and analysis on videos. The analysis is done using a pre-trained model for object detection, and the results are saved in an output video.

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package manager)

You will need the following libraries to run the program:

- `ultralytics` (for YOLOv5 model)
- Other libraries used in the project

To install `ultralytics`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

You may need to install other libraries based on the usage of your project. You can do that manually or create your own `requirements.txt` by running the following:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

```

## Running the Program

1. **Prepare Your Video**:  
   - Delete the content of the `studs` folder.
   - Place the new video file you want to analyze into the `input_videos` folder.
   - Rename the video to `testmatch.mp4`.

2. **Run the Program**:  
   Before running execute the color_assignment.ipynb notebook.
   Also add a cropped zoomed in image of a player into output_videos called cropped_images.jpg.
   Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Then, run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Wait for the Analysis to Complete**:  
   The program will process the video and generate an output file. The processed video will be saved in the `output_videos` folder with the name `testmatch_output.mp4`.

4. **View the Result**:  
   Once the processing is complete, you can find the final analyzed video in the `output_videos` folder.

## Notes

- Ensure that the input video is in `.mp4` format and is named `testmatch.mp4` for the program to work correctly.
- The program may take some time to analyze the video, depending on the length and complexity of the content.
- Make sure to delete old content in the `studies` folder to avoid processing errors.
